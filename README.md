# STM32_bare_metal_lld
Register level drivers written for the STM32 F407VG Discovery board, MISRA C compilent, developed in Keil IDE. 

This repository is unique as it consists of only register level codes and not HAL codes which are much easier to generate. By developing register level codes, I can get a much better understanding of the peripherals of the STM32.
